.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B run\-parts
runs all the executable files named within constraints described below, found
in directory
.IR directory .
Other files and directories are silently ignored.

If neither the \-\-lsbsysinit option nor the \-\-regex option is given
then the names must consist entirely of upper and lower case letters,
digits, underscores, and hyphens.                           
                                                                                
If the \-\-lsbsysinit option is given, then the names must not end
in .dpkg\-old  or .dpkg\-dist or .dpkg\-new or .dpkg\-tmp, and must
belong to one or more of the following namespaces: the
LANANA-assigned namespace (^[a\-z0\-9]+$); the LSB hierarchical and
reserved namespaces (^_?([a\-z0\-9_.]+\-)+[a\-z0\-9]+$);
and the Debian cron script namespace (^[a\-z0\-9][a\-z0\-9\-]*$).      

If the \-\-regex option is given, the names must match the custom
extended regular expression specified as that option's argument.

Files are run in the lexical sort order of their names unless the
\-\-reverse option is given, in which case they are run in the
opposite order.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-test
print the names of the scripts which would be run, but don't actually run
them.
.TP
.B \-\-list
print the names of the all matching files (not limited to executables),
but don't actually run them. This option cannot be used with --test.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
print the name of each script to stderr before running.
.TP
.B \-\-report
similar to
.BR \-\-verbose ,
but only prints the name of scripts which produce output.  The script's name is printed to whichever of stdout or stderr the script first produces output on.
.TP
.B \-\-reverse
reverse the scripts' execution order.
.TP
.B \-\-exit\-on\-error
exit as soon as a script returns with a non-zero exit code.
.TP
.B \-\-lsbsysinit
use LSB namespaces instead of classical behavior.
.TP
.B \-\-new\-session
run each script in a separate process session.  If you use this option,
killing run-parts will not kill the currently running script, it will
run until completion.
.TP
.BI \-\-regex= RE
validate filenames against custom extended regular expression
.IR RE .
See the EXAMPLES section for an example.
.TP
.BI "\-u, \-\-umask=" umask
sets the umask to
.I umask
before running the scripts.
.I umask
should be specified in octal.  By default the umask is set to 022.
.TP
.BI "\-a, \-\-arg=" argument
pass
.I argument
to the scripts.  Use
.B --arg
once for each argument you want passed.
.TP
.B "\-\-"
specifies that this is the end of the options.  Any filename after
.B "\-\-"
will be not be interpreted as an option even if it starts with a
hyphen.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
display usage information and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
display version and copyright and exit.
